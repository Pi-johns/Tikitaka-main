</h1>
<h>GENERAL</h>
<p>This document is the entire T&C. No other provision may be included, or read in.
Failure by us to strictly enforce a provision or the periodic relaxation of a provision
in this document does not amount to an implied waiver of any provision or of any
rights associated to the provision.
These T&C may not be waived, amended, suspended, ceded or transferred unless
authorised in writing by head office.
These provisions may not be enforceable where unforeseeable or uncontrollable
circumstances exist making it not reasonably possible to perform in terms of this
T&C (force majeure).<p>
PAYMENTS

estimated delivery date after your balance payment reflects on our Bank

DELIVERIES
Delivery will take place once we receive the full amount (see 2.3 above). A delivery
fee is automatically added to the invoice.
All delivery times are an approximation. Although we try to give the most accurate
dates of delivery, we cannot be held liable for any delays that may occur. We will
contact you to make arrangements for the delivery. All deliveries will take place on a
week day between 09h00 and 16h00, excluding public holidays.
Once delivered, you must inspect the product for any defects whilst our delivery
staff are present, and sign a document verifying you received the product and that it
is in good condition. We may rely on this document as proof that the product was in
good condition when delivered, and that it met your specifications. If the product is
not in a good condition, or doesn’t meet your specifications, then the product must
be returned on the same transport vehicle that delivered the product, otherwise
you are responsible for any costs in transporting the product back to Head Office.
On the day of delivery, the area where the product will be placed must be clearly
marked and cleared of any furniture, breakable items and pets. Our staff are not
permitted to move or rearrange your furniture. We will not be liable for any
damages or costs due to your failure to clear the area.
Our products are usually large, therefore it is your responsibility to find out product
dimensions and whether the product can fit through any door, stairwell or passage
way. We will not hoist the product over any balconies, walls or through windows. If
there is no other option but to hoist the product or to implement any other non-
standard method to get the product in the desired location, then you must arrange
this at your own cost and risk. We do not install or mount the products once
delivered. You may be liable to pay any additional delivery costs where you send the
product back or where you failed to be at the premises on the date of delivery.
For an upfront fee, we can relocate (transport) your product elsewhere.
COLLECTIONS
If you prefer to collect the product at your own expense, then you must transport
the product using a suitable vehicle and store the product in the correct manner, as
instructed by us. You must supply your own transport equipment (ropes, blankets
etc). You must arrange a time and date with Warehouse Manager for collection of
products, allow 24 hours for preparation. No collections over weekends or public
holidays.
We will not be liable for any damage caused to the product if it is transported by
you. The invoice must be presented by you, or any person collecting on your behalf
before we release the product.
